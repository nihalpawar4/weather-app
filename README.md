# Weather App using JavaScript

This is a simple weather application built using JavaScript.
The application allows you to search for a location and get the current weather condition.

## Installation

To use the application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app-js.git
cd weather-app-js
open index.html

## Usage

Once you have opened the index.html file in your web browser, you can enter a location in the search bar and press enter to get the current weather conditions .
The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
The application displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon for the current weather conditions.

## Development

If you would like to modify the code and develop the application further, you can use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code to edit the files. 
The application logic is written in the index.js file, and the HTML and CSS are written in the index.html and style.css files.

You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. You can sign up for a free API key on their website and replace the API_KEY variable in the index.js file with your own API key.
